### Relative Strength Index ( RSI ).

Objective of using RSI is to help the trader to identify oversold and overbought price areas.

20 - over sold
80 - over bought

> RSI is not used as a standalone idicator by traders. It is used along with other candlestick patterns.

### Moving Average Convergence & Divergence ( MACD )

__Convergence__ - when the two moving averages move towards each other

__Divergence__ - MA move away from each other.

Calculate MACD value over a series of 12 & 26 days EMA.

When MACD line cross the centerline from the negative territory to positive territory - Look for buying

Opposite - Look for selling.

MACD is simply the difference between 12 and 26 EMA.

_Bullish_ - MACD cross the 9 days EMA where MACD line is greater than 9 day EMA.

_Bearish_ - MACD line cross below the 9 days EMA where MACD line is lesser than 9 days EMA.

> Work quite well when there is a strong trend and are not too useful when the markers are moving sideways.

### Bollinger Bands

Used to determine overbought and oversold levels.

The BB has 3 components:

* The middle line which is the 20 days  SMA of the closing prices.
* An upper band - this is the +2 standard deviation of the middle line.
* A lower band - this is the -2 standard deviation of the middle line


SD is applied on the 20 days SMA.

Buy at lower band 
Sell at Upper band price
