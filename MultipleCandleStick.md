P2 green candle partially engulfs P1's red candle, however, the engulfing should be at least 50% but less than 100%.

__Example :__ if P1's range is 12, P2 range should be at least 6 or higher but less then 12.

Smilar to _Bearish engulfing_ with minor variations.

The red candle on P2 engulfs abut 50 to 100 % of P1 green candle.

The first candle is usually long and second candle has a small body. The second candle is generally opposite in color to the first candle.

* A trend reversal is possible

   * ___Bullish harami___ 
   * ___Bearsih harami___

## Bullish Harami
